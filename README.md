## Abstract

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is perhaps the most important energy discovery in the last half century. As a result of fracking, U.S. production of oil and natural gas has increased dramatically. For each one of the fracking wells, there is a site of extraction on the landscape. Even though many of those wells are no longer active and have been plugged, they contributed to a decentralized network of pollution and environmental harms, from deforestation to make open space for the well pads, to the inevitable leaching of toxins into the groundwater, similar to the coal mines. We are curious on the situation Pennsylvania is facing. Where are those fracking wells? Does the situation require an urgent change for the sake of the environment and our health? How fracking affects the environment in Southern Pennsylvania? The questions guided us to create a series of maps for the audience to navigate and manipulate. By overlaying the locations of fracking well buffer zones, power plants, and urban areas on the same map, we can better visualize and understand the environmental impacts of fracking: fracking can serve as the root of a chain reaction that ultimately create environmental hazards and detrimentally affect the health of people who live in the region. While fracking is banned in most urbanized areas, many of the fracking wells in southwestern Pennsylvania have a close proximity to the border of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Additionally, there are many fracking wells that are close to large power plants, as the latter relies on many of those wells to provide power to its facilities.
